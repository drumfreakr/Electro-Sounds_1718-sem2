# Assignment B

Assignment B:
Use a selection of your current p5js sketches which use code to animate abstract, geometric visuals.

Sketch size: Fullscreen
Due: Week 10

For assignment B, the sketches in archive are the first few sketches that I created and started with. The sketches in final are the more polished ones which fully demonstrates my understanding of the various algorithms.
