# **GlITCHED OUT**

## **Description**

Abstract visuals that respond to sound in real time. Aesthetically, I am interested in exploring glitchy environments that react and transform when exposed to differing frequencies. I am very interested in glitch imagery, which is the practice of using digital or analog errors for aesthetic purposes and in my project, I want to explore and combine these concepts both sonically and visually. In order to do so, I will create a series of algorithmic Glitch and Noise sketches that respond to sound. The sound aesthetics that I have in mind are inspired by ambient electronic music such as Thursday Afternoon by Brian Eno. The project will be both an online application, and one that can be used for a live performance. Images are to be projected on a large-scale screen.

Project falls under: Interactive, Audio Reactive, Live Performance and Calm.

## **Methodology**

First and foremost, I have previously done Noise, glitch and Sound-reactive sketches prior to this project. I intend to use them as the basic foundation on which I can build upon.

**Level 1: Noise and Sound-reactive sketches:**

I intend to improve on my previous sketches while having my 'Glitched Out' project in foresight. I aim to create more diverse and complex glitch and sound-reactive sketches in order to gain a myriad of different ideas to choose from, and to also get to know the concepts in even greater detail.

**Level 2: Combining both concepts into one sketch:**

With the many sketches in my arsenal, I will go a step further by adding the Sound-reactive component into my chosen Glitch Noise sketches. I intend to tag specific bands of frequencies that will generate and possibly glitch the images on the fly.

**Level 3: Improving on my glitch aesthetics:**

 I intend to work on getting more variables in my sketch and work towards achieving a nicer aesthetic quality to the sketch. I will only do so after going through levels 1 and 2 and gaining a better perspective on which challenge to undertake.

**Level 4: Writing the music and completing my Final Sketch:**

With the sketch created, I will carry on with the composition for the sketch. I have already decided on writing an ambient piece to portray the calmness I strive for listeners to feel as they watch my sketch transform.

As for my live performance component, I intend to make use of a midi controller as a performative tool. I aim to make use of the midi controller's knobs to change variables in my sketch while performing.

## **Visual Sketches**

Here are some works that have given me inspiration and will serve as an example to the visual aesthetic I am going for in my project 'Glitched Out'.

## **Sound Track Details**

Ambient Electronic music is the genre for the sound track that I have chosen. Ideally, the composition will focus on calming and evolving tones and soundscapes with percussive hits from time to time. I found my inspiration in Brian Eno's Thursday Afternoon, which excelled in evoking a calm emotion in me. The track isn't focused on being overtly musical or melodic, but instead it transports the listener to somewhere they have not been before. It is interesting that it conjures the sense of space musically too. These aspects from Eno's music seem to fit my ideal piece that I feel will bring the best out of my Noise Field Project therefore I am heading towards achieving this.
