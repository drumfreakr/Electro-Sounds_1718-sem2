# **GLITCHED OUT**

## **Description**

Abstract visuals that respond to sound in real time. Aesthetically, I am interested in exploring glitchy environments that react and transform when exposed to differing frequencies. Glitch imagery is the practice of using digital or analog errors for aesthetic purposes and in my project, I explored and combined these concepts both sonically and visually.

'Glitched Out' is a sound-reactive sketch that creates visual glitches on my animation when exposed to the different frequencies in my soundtrack. I was inspired by Ryoji Ikeda's Test Pattern installation.   

The soundtracks that I composed were inspired by Brian Eno's ambient electronic music. The sketch is both an online application, and one that can be mapped to a midi controller for live performances.

## Reflection ##

Through this whole project, I have learnt a whole lot about coding and it's capabilities. Prior to this project, I never really set foot into the world of programming as I always had the thinking that it was difficult to learn. I never knew that coding could be a creative tool for artists to create interesting visuals and artwork.

Initially, I faced difficulties as I didn't understand any of the programming jargon. Through the assignments that was given, I slowly came to understand how to think logically while coding and these assignments proved to be very useful as it sparked even more interest in p5js for me. The feeling of completing my first few sketches were great as I never knew I could do this. It made me aspire to bring my ideas to life with coding despite knowing it would be a tough task to undertake. I was motivated nonetheless as I have seen that it is possible for me to achieve what I wanted with a little bit of effort and practice. I set fourth by creating a sketch everyday in order to grasp the concepts better.

The algorithm assignment was the one that I enjoyed doing as there were so many new concepts to learn that was interesting. I especially enjoyed doing noise and pixel glitch sketches as the outcomes are always different with each iteration. The amount of time spent doing these sketches was what brought me to use glitch imagery as my final sketch.

Looking back at the semester, I am really surprised with how much I have learnt over the weeks. I never knew that coding could be a fun and creative process. Despite the hardships that come with learning something new, I am glad that I put in a lot of effort to practice coding as I feel it is an essential skill to have. The fact that I can now code visuals for my music represents huge progress in my development as an artist and I am very thankful for being exposed to the world of code.
