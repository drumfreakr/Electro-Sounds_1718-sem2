# Assignment D

For this assignment, we were tasked to create a browser based application using our own sound track and a range of coding techniques we have learned so far.

The sketches in archive are the list of works I have created which led to the final sketch. As for the sketches in the final folder, they are the ones in my browser based application.

I have included the online, midi and full colour versions of my final sketch in the folder.
